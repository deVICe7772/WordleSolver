# Wordle solver bot

This is a basic c++ wordle solver WITHOUT any Interface. I do plan on tring various different logics of solving wordle. I will be updating this repository in verions for different logics for solving wordle.

This solver doesn't need any user interactions yet.

This code doesn't give any colour output in the terminal but gives 'B' for black, 'G' for green and 'Y' for yellow for any word in the following line.

The rules of wordle are the same as the original wordle. The dataset of words used are in the file in.text(uses a total of 12972 words) and the solver returns an output to output.txt files
